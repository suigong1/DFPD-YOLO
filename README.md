DFPD-YOLO: Diffusion-Focused Pyramid Dynamic Task-aligned Detection Head YOLO

Introduction

Object detection in road scenes presents significant challenges due to multi-scale variations and complex backgrounds. Many existing methods struggle with detecting small objects that have blurred features and low contrast with their surroundings. Additionally, traditional detection heads separate classification and localization tasks, neglecting their potential correlation and limiting overall performance.

To address these issues, we propose DFPD-YOLO (Diffusion-Focused Pyramid Dynamic Task-aligned Detection Head YOLO). Our model introduces improvements in feature extraction and task alignment, enhancing detection accuracy and robustness. The key contributions are as follows:

FocusFeature and Feature Diffusion Mechanism in the Neck: These components improve the context-awareness of multi-scale features, helping detect small objects more accurately.

Dynamic Task-aligned Detection Head (DTDH): This structure strengthens the interaction between classification and localization tasks, improving detection performance.

WIoU as the Bounding Box Regression Loss: This loss function reduces the impact of low-quality samples on anchor box regression, speeds up network convergence, and enhances localization precision.

Extensive Experiments on KITTI Dataset: The results show significant improvements, especially for small and occluded road objects.

Network Architecture

The DFPD-YOLO network consists of the following major components:

Backbone: Extracts deep hierarchical features from input images.

Neck (FocusFeature & Feature Diffusion Mechanism): Enhances feature representation to improve small object detection.

Detection Head (DTDH): Aligns classification and localization tasks dynamically, improving detection robustness.

Loss Function (WIoU): Optimizes bounding box regression for better localization accuracy.
